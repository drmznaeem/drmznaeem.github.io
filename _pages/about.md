Hi and welcome to my website! :wave:

Welcome to the official website of Dr Muhammad Zahid Naeem, an academic, researcher, and consultant dedicated to bridging the gap between education, research, and industry. With a PhD in Economics from the University of Brunei Darussalam and over a decade of experience in academia and consultancy, I am committed to fostering innovative learning, producing impactful research, and offering expert advisory services.

My academic journey has taken me through esteemed institutions where I have served as an Assistant Professor, Program Coordinator, and research supervisor. My work revolves around economic analysis, financial policy, sustainable development, and the intersection of education and industry. I strongly believe that learning should be dynamic, research should be actionable, and academia must stay connected to real-world challenges.

Through this platform, I aim to share my research contributions, insights on emerging trends, and professional services tailored to individuals, businesses, and academic institutions. Whether you are a student, researcher, or industry professional, I invite you to explore my work and collaborate in shaping meaningful solutions for today’s global challenges.
